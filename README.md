# autonomous-navigation.github.io
a comprehensive approach that combines Lidar sensing, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees* (RRT*), and Frontier-Based algorithms to achieve enhanced path planning, exploration, and motion control for mobile robots. The integration of these techniques addresses the challenges of obstacle avoidance, real-time decision-making, and efficient exploration.
